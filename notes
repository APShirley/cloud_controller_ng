- Rename philosopher class
- Add tests for philosopher class

- Figure out differences between V3 and V2 app environment hash
  - for the v3 environment class, we use it to send task to diego
    (VCAP::CloudController::Diego::V3::Environment)
  - the main level environment class is used to stage and desire an app
    (VCAP::CloudController::Diego::Environment)
  - Refactor both classes to remove duplication of functionality
  - Is there a way for task protocol to use the normal environment class and
    then tuck on the remaining env vars that it requires? That allows us to
    compose the hash rather than have an exclusive class.

- Why does app presenter recreate the vcap_application hash?
  - Because the v3 app model doesn't have that function.

- Consolidate creation of application environment hash in a single place
- Diego Environment Presenter
